## Idea

The model is located at the master branch.
Each contributor shall have a branch named "sandbox_"name"
New features or content to the model will first be initiated with an issue. Once the issue has been agreed upon the asignee will work on the new feature on her branch.
Once the content is ready to be merged into the master branch the contributor shall generate a pull request from her branch to the master branch.
The contributor has to keep the pull request free of conflicts in order to ease the review and merge of the pull request. 
The working team will review weekly the pull requests and merge them into the master.
